/**
 * Elves have a secret timestamp: it’s the exact date and time when Santa Claus takes off with the sleigh 🛷 to deliver gifts around the world. But at the North Pole they use a super weird format to store the time: YYYY*MM*DD@HH|mm|ss NP (example: 2025*12*25@00|00|00 NP).
 *
 * Your mission is to write a function that receives:
 *
 * fromTime → reference date in elf format (YYYY*MM*DD@HH|mm|ss NP).
 * takeOffTime → the same takeoff date, also in elf format.
 * The function must return:
 *
 * The full seconds remaining until takeoff.
 * If we’re exactly at takeoff time → 0.
 * If takeoff already happened → a negative number indicating how many seconds have passed since then.
 * 🎯 Rules
 * First convert the elf format to a timestamp. The NP suffix indicates official North Pole time (no time zones or DST), so you can treat it as if it were UTC.
 * Use differences in seconds, not milliseconds.
 * Always round down (floor): only full seconds.
