/**
 * Two elves are playing a turn-based battle. Each one has a deck of moves represented as a string where each character is an action.
 *
 * A Normal attack: deals 1 point of damage if it’s not blocked
 * B Block: blocks a normal attack (A)
 * F Strong attack: deals 2 points of damage, cannot be blocked
 * Both elves start with 3 hit points. The first elf to reach 0 hit points or less loses and the battle ends immediately (no further moves are processed).
 *
 * Round rules
 *
 * If both use an attack (A or F), both take damage according to the type.
 * B blocks A, but does not block F.
 * Everything is resolved simultaneously.
 * Your task
 *
 * Return the result of the battle as a number:
 *
 * 1 → if Elf 1 wins
 * 2 → if Elf 2 wins
 * 0 → if it’s a draw (both reach 0 at the same time or end with the same health)
