/**
 * The elves have found the encrypted code that protects the door to Santa’s workshop 🔐. The PIN has 4 digits, and it is hidden inside blocks like these:
 *
 * [1++][2-][3+][<]
 * Write a function that deciphers the PIN from the code.
 *
 * The code is made up of blocks between brackets [...] and each block generates one digit of the PIN.
 *
 * A normal block has the form [nOP...], where n is a number (0-9) and after it there can be a list of (optional) operations.
 *
 * The operations are applied in order to the number and are:
 *
 * + adds 1
 * - subtracts 1
 * The result is always a digit (mod 10 arithmetic), for example 9 + 1 → 0 and 0 - 1 → 9.
 *
 * There is also the special block [<], which repeats the digit from the previous block.
 *
 * If in the end there are fewer than 4 digits, you must return null.
 *
 * 🧩 Examples
 * decodeSantaPin('[1++][2-][3+][<]')
 * // "3144"
 *
 * decodeSantaPin('[9+][0-][4][<]')
 * // "0944"
 *
 * decodeSantaPin('[1+][2-]')
 * // null (only 2 digits)
